# FAIR Maturity Indicators JSON-LD generator
FAIR maturity indicators JSON-LD generator for nano-related datasets/databases/models

This repository aims at generating JSON-LD from maturity indicators (MI) to assess the FAIRness of datasets/models/experiments related to the NanoToxicology domain for risk assessment applications.

The web app uses a JSON file that contains maturity indicators lists description generated by the [FAIR Maturity Indicators **Generator** for NanoSafety Data Reusability](https://github.com/ammar257ammar/fair-maturity-indicators-generator)
